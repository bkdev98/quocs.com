Internal project at [Quang Trung Software City](https://www.qtsc.com.vn/en/) where my university is located.

The OMS helps minimize the amount of paperwork and procedure for QTSC. Main features include managing the agenda of the day, tracking the status of the agenda, managing the employees' leave requests and internal announcements.

Made with React Native, Redux and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Nothing fancy here but this is the first project I worked on that is used by a major organization. I learned a lot about the importance of user experience and how to design a system that is easy to use and understand.
