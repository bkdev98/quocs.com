A project I built at [MoMo](https://momo.vn), MiMo is a browser-based no-code platform to build mini apps.

Integrated with Mini App Template - a white-label mini app codebase that is highly customizable for multiple use cases, MiMo is widely used by MoMo's partners such as iPOS, Highlands, Starbucks, The Coffee House, etc... to build mini apps for their own business, serving millions of users.
