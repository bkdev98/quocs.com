> Full-featured SaaS Point of Sale system.

This is the one project I most proud of in the early days of my career.

The MVP with (product, customer, order & invoice) management, connected to a thermal printer and a cashier drawer, was built over the weekend, and on prod the next Monday.

To this day, Innoteq POS is still in use by many coffee shops and restaurants in HCMC.
