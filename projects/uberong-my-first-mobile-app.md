Fall 2017, 19 years old me - a competitive college student decided to join a mobile contest at his school. With only some React knowledge at the time, I decided to take a [Stephen Grider's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) and get my hands dirty with React Native.

I was obssessed with diverse and flavorful street food culture in HCMC. However, despite their culinary prowess, many hawkers and small food businesses struggled to compete with larger, more established players in the food delivery market. Also at that time, Vietnam government has just banned all traders on the sidewalk. This gap in the market sparked the idea for Uberong.

> **"Uberong": Uber + "Hawker" in Vietnamese**

The app was built with the (nostalgic) Exponent and connected to a simple Express + MongoDB API. Also the order tracking process was done with Google Maps API and Socket.io (which was my proudest achievement at the time).

Never make it way to production, but the second price at [FU Mobile Challenge 2017](https://daihoc.fpt.edu.vn/lap-trinh-ung-dung-tren-dien-thoai-khep-lai-mua-thu-ba/) pushing me further into the world of mobile development.
